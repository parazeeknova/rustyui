//! Application State Management Module
//!
//! This module contains the core application state management logic for RustUI.
//! It defines the main application states, handles navigation between different
//! pages, manages user interface state, and controls the overall flow of the
//! application.
//!
//! The module provides a clean separation between UI rendering and state management,
//! making it easy to add new pages and features while maintaining a consistent
//! navigation experience.

/// Application State Enumeration
///
/// Represents all possible states (pages) that the application can be in.
/// Each variant corresponds to a different screen or page in the user interface.
///
/// This enum is used to track which page is currently active and to handle
/// navigation between different sections of the application. The state determines
/// which rendering function is called and what content is displayed to the user.

///
/// This struct holds all the state information needed to run the application.
