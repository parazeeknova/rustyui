//! snix - Template & Boilerplate Manager
//!
//! A terminal-based user interface application for managing development boilerplates,
//! project templates, and code snippets. Built with Rust and ratatui for a fast,
//! efficient, and beautiful terminal experience.
//!
//! snix provides developers with a centralized tool to:
//! - Manage project templates and boilerplates for various tech stacks
//! - Browse and download community-created templates from a marketplace
//! - Store and organize frequently used code snippets
//! - Configure development workflow preferences
